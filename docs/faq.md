# Frequently Asked Questions

#### How to load the clusters file back to Python?
Simply use the function provided in `tools`:
```python
import mosaic

clusterfile = '...'
clusters = mosaic.tools.load_clusters(clusterfile)
```

#### Is it possible to use cross validation together with silhouette score?
The new release `v0.3.0` refactored the classes, so that the [`sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) can be used. Check out the [cv example](#cross-validation-of-parameters).

### Should I upgrade the package?
You can check out the CHANGELOG.md to see what changed.

### How can I interpretate the results?
Check out our publication for two detailed examples.

### Is it possible to install the CLI only?
Partially, yes. If you do not want to screw up your current Python environment there are multiples possibilities. Either create a virtual environment on your own via `conda` or `venv`, or you can simply use [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)

### Is the silhouette method implemented?
Yes, simply use the `score` method implemented in the `Clustering` class.

### I want to use the UMAP embedding!
This is still possible if you switch to the version 0.3.2. We removed that feature in newer versions.

### Feature X is missing
If you believe that a crucial functionality/method is missing, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/moldyn/MoSAIC/issues) and describe the missing functionality and why it should be added. Alternatively, you can implement it yourself and create a PR to add it to this package, see [contributing guide](../contributing).


### I found a bug. What to do next?
If you find a bug in this package, it is very kind of you to open an issue/bug report.
