## [Unreleased]


## [0.4.1] - 2023-04-04
### API changes warning ⚠️:
- Removed the `grid_b` keyword from all plot examples to support a broader
  range of matplotlib versions.
- Removed `prettypyplot` dependency
- Added `matplotlib` dependency

### Added Features and Improvements 🙌:
- Now checking whether all features have a non-zero and finite standard deviation


## [0.4.0] - 2023-03-28
### API changes warning ⚠️:
- Class `UMAPSimilarity` was removed

### Added Features and Improvements 🙌:
- Added py3.11 support
- All new MkDocs, including tutorials 🎉

### Other changes:
- Fixed CI's


## [0.3.2] - 2022-09-21
### Other changes:
- Update reference and add `CITATION.cff`

### Bugfix 🐛:
- Fixing `AssertionError` when Similarity matrix is not in range [0, 1], see [#9](/../../issues/9)
- Add support for `numpy>=1.23.0`, #13
- Fix support for `prettypyplot<0.8.x`, #11


## [0.3.1] - 2022-08-04
### Bugfix 🐛:
- Fixing floating-point error for `np.float16, np.float32` in `Similarity().fit()`, see [#9](/../../issues/9)

### Other changes:
- Use deprecated decorator for `UMAPSimilarity`
- Refactor all type definitions
- Ensure using the same MODES, METRICS, and NORMS  in the cli and the package itself


## [0.3.0] - 2022-07-22
### API changes warning ⚠️:
- Module `tools` was renamed to `utils`
- `load_clusters` needs to be accessed via `mosaic.utils`
- Change the default precision from `half` to `single` in CI (`__main__.py`)
- Rename in `Similarity` class the parameter `online` to `low_memory` and in
  `mosaic similarity` the flag `--online` to `--low-memory`
- Rename in `Similarity` class the parameter `knn_estimator` to `use_knn_estimator`
- `Similarity.fit` and `Clustering.fit` are returning `self` which allows a
  chaining like `sim = Similarity().fit(X)`

### Added Features and Improvements 🙌:
- `GridSearchCV` class was added, allowing for easy silhouette-CV basedr
  parameter search
- `Similarity` class derives now from `sklearn.base.BaseEstimator`
- `Clustering` class derives now from `sklearn.base.BaseEstimator` and `sklearn.base.BaseMixin`
- `fit_transform` and `transform`  method were added to `Similarity` class
- `fit_predict` method was added to `Clustering` class
- `score` method (for silhouette score) was added to `Clustering` class
- Added LGTM reports
- Allow to select the desired precision in the CI directly
- Improved clusters sorting algorithm to prefer larger clusters
- `mode='kmedoids'` was added to CI

### Bugfix 🐛:
- Fix bug of `load_clusters` in case of a single cluster
- Fix bug where `mode='kmedoids'` can not be executed with `n_clusters`
- Fix bug for `mode='kmedoids'`, preventing masking diagonal
- Prevent interpolation in plot
- Enforce higher precision on storing correlation matrix to remove artifacts
  of slight deviation from symmetry

### Other changes:
- Improved test functions of utils module
- Add more tests for clustering module
- Fixed some typos
- Improved README


## [0.2.2] - 2022-04-25
### Added Features and Improvements 🙌:
- Officially support python 3.10

### Other changes:
- Adding many helpful links to PyPI
- Remove dark-mode-only image from PyPI readme
- Add code coverage report via Codecov


## [0.2.1] - 2022-04-07
### API changes warning ⚠️:
- Removed `n_iterations` parameter from `Clustering`

### Added Features and Improvements 🙌:
- Added clustering mode `mode='kmedoids'` for k-medoids clustering
- Added tools module to reopen clusters

### Other changes:
- Improved some test functions


## [0.2.0] - 2022-04-01
### API changes warning ⚠️:
- Renamed cli script `mosaic`, former `MoSAIC`
- Renamed package to `mosaic-clustering`
- Renamed repository!!!

### Added Features and Improvements 🙌:
- Added MoSAIC logo
- Added changelog
- Unified extra requirements of module, use `[all], [umap], [docs], [testing]` with pip
- Add toy matrix of paper and script to generate similar matrices
- Improve html of docs
- Improve README

### Bugfix 🐛:
- Fix path of CLI script
- Fix coverage run
- Fix PEP 585 warnings by importing `typing` classes from `beartype.typing`
- Reset `Clustering.labels_` on calling `CLustering.fit(...)`
- Allow also numpy types, e.g., `np.float64`, or `np.int64` for resolution parameter

### Other changes:
- Increase required beartype version `0.8.1->0.10.4`
- Rename `DistanceMatrix` to `SimilarityMatrix`
- Fix example in `Clustering` to satisfy typing requirements
- Change import in `_typing.py` to non-private
- Improve some typings
- Require `typing_extensions` only for python < 3.9


## [0.1.1] - 2022-01-24
### Added Features and Improvements 🙌:
- Add `labels_` attribute to `Clustering`

### Bugfix 🐛:
- Use `metric='precomputed'` for UMAP
- Relax check of symmetric input by using `np.allclose()`
